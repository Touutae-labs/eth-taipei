# DailySavings: Automated Yield-Bearing Savings Protocol

üåü Overview
DailySavings is a next-generation decentralized savings protocol developed for ETH Taipei Hackathon that enables users to create automated savings plans with reward incentives. The protocol leverages EIP-2612 permits for gasless approvals and uses a relayer system to automatically execute savings transfers at specified intervals.

‚ú® Key Features
Automated Savings Plans: Users can create recurring savings plans that execute automatically
Yield-Bearing: Savers earn ZRT (Zircuit Reward Tokens) as incentives based on configurable yield rates
Gasless Setup: Uses EIP-2612 permits for gasless token approvals
Multiple Intervals: Support for daily, weekly, monthly, or custom time intervals
Zero Maintenance: After setup, the relayer handles all execution automatically
Multiple Token Support: Configurable support for various ERC2 and Get Pay as My Token
Relayer Infrastructure: Reliable execution through our decentralized relayer networ

Relayer Monitoring: Our relayer service monitors for plan execution times
Automatic Execution: When your interval is reached:

Yield Distribution: Rewards are automatically sent to your wallet
